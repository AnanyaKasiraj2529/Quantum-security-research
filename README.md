📌 Project Overview
This repository presents a hybrid quantum-safe communication framework that integrates:
- BB84 Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)
- Lattice-Based Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)
- Hybrid QKD + PQC Authentication Model
- Quantum Bit Error Rate (QBER) Analysis
- Eavesdropper (Eve) Attack Simulation
The goal is to design and simulate a quantum-resilient key exchange protocol suitable for resource-constrained IoT environments, addressing scalability, side-channel risks, and future quantum threats.
This implementation supports the research work presented in:
Quantum-Safe Protocols Design for IoT Communications: Critical Observation and Analysis (CISCON 2025)

🧠 Motivation
With the rise of quantum computing:
- Classical cryptographic schemes (RSA, ECC) are vulnerable to Shor’s Algorithm
- IoT systems operate under low power and limited computation
- Pure QKD systems suffer from scalability and noise sensitivity
- Lattice-based cryptography faces side-channel vulnerabilities
This project explores a hybrid security architecture combining the strengths of both paradigms.
