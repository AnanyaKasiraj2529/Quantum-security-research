## Original Implementation

All algorithms and simulations in this repository were independently
implemented as part of my undergraduate research project on
quantum-safe authentication for IoT systems.

No tutorial or external implementation was reused.

📌 Project Overview
<img width="608" height="368" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c91d85c6-9145-4f2a-af3e-a64cb347a439" />

This repository presents a hybrid quantum-safe communication framework that integrates:
- BB84 Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)
- Lattice-Based Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)
- Hybrid QKD + PQC Authentication Model
- Quantum Bit Error Rate (QBER) Analysis
- Eavesdropper (Eve) Attack Simulation
The goal is to design and simulate a quantum-resilient key exchange protocol suitable for resource-constrained IoT environments, addressing scalability, side-channel risks, and future quantum threats.
This implementation supports the research work presented in:
Quantum-Safe Protocols Design for IoT Communications: Critical Observation and Analysis (CISCON 2025)

## My Contributions

- Implemented BB84 QKD protocol simulation from scratch
- Designed hybrid key distribution workflow
- Integrated lattice-based authentication model
- Developed comparative performance evaluation framework

🧠 Motivation
With the rise of quantum computing:
- Classical cryptographic schemes (RSA, ECC) are vulnerable to Shor’s Algorithm
- IoT systems operate under low power and limited computation
- Pure QKD systems suffer from scalability and noise sensitivity
- Lattice-based cryptography faces side-channel vulnerabilities
This project explores a hybrid security architecture combining the strengths of both paradigms.
